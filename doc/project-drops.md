# Drops — the endgame loot tier

Karkia stage 5. **The wiring is done; no loot is authored yet.** This is the plan for
the content pass, plus everything about the drop system that is not obvious from the
code. Companion to [doc/karkia-roadmap.md](karkia-roadmap.md).

---

## 1. Where this stands

`scripts/rewire-karkia-drops.py` (applied 2026-09-07, idempotent, `--restore`able)
fixed the plumbing. **Karkia currently drops nothing.** That is deliberate — it was
previously dropping *the wrong thing*, and correct-and-empty is a better base to
author onto than plausible-and-wrong.

What it corrected:

- Karkia's own drop tables were **831/832/835/851–854**, copied verbatim from Jrose.
  Three of those are live for our own monsters — 831 Desert Scavenger, 832 Agitated
  Desert Scavenger, and **851 Fearsome Terrasaurus King**, our top boss. Authoring
  Karkia loot into them would have handed it to Oro. They are now **900–906**,
  keeping Jrose's own grouping (one shared table for the Cemetery roster, one for
  Spire Village, one per boss).
- Karkia's **zone fallback** (see §2) resolved to `ITEM_DROP` rows 86, 87, 88, 131,
  133–136 and 144 — which were live tables for thirteen of our own low-level
  monsters (Melt Dut, Moss Ant, Moss Golem, the Pomics, the Rackies, Beetle,
  Assistant Chef Woopie). Rows 86 and 87 are literally named *"EVE Zone (Fishing
  System)"* and *"(Farming System)"*. Those tables moved to **940–948** with their
  users repointed, so the zone numbers are Karkia's now.
- Drop chance (`col 20`) went **20 → 80**, our own level-200+ median. At 20, ~80% of
  Karkia's rolls fell through to the zone table; that is what players were picking up.

| | Karkia table |
|---|---|
| Cemetery roster (20 monsters) | 900 |
| Revived Quarantine Officer | 901 |
| D-Seed | 902 |
| Hebarn Officer Pazugenti | 903 |
| Hebarn Officer Scylla Mira | 904 |
| Corroded Golem + Revived Veteran | 905 |
| Spire Village roster (10, incl. Drake α) | 906 |
| zone fallback, per zone | 86, 87, 88, 131, 133–136, 144 |

---

## 2. How the drop system actually works

From `CCal::Get_DropITEM` (`src/common/calculation.cpp:132`). Worth reading before
touching any of this — three of its properties are surprising.

```
drop_var = (WorldDROP + col20 - rand(1..100) - (levelgap + 16)*3.5 - 10 + dropRate) * 0.38
if drop_var <= 0                     -> no drop at all
if rand(1..100) <= col19             -> money instead of an item
if col20 - rand(1..100) >= 0         -> table = col 18   (the monster's own)
else                                 -> table = the ZONE NUMBER
cell = ITEM_DROP[table][1 + rand(0..min(drop_var, 30))]
```

- **A drop-table id and a zone id are the same namespace.** There is no separation.
  This is why Karkia's zone numbers were already somebody's loot table, and it will
  happen again to any content imported at a new zone number. Check both before
  allocating.
- **`col 20` is doing three jobs at once**: how often anything drops, how wide a
  slice of the table is reachable, and how often the zone fallback is used. It is not
  a clean "drop rate" knob.
- **A cell is `type * 1000 + number`**, so `item.m_cType = cell / 1000` and
  `m_nItemNo = cell % 1000`. **Item numbers above 999 cannot be dropped**, full stop.
  That is a tighter limit than the item *encoding*, which `tagBaseITEM` widened to an
  11-bit number (0–2047) — the drop table simply cannot address them.
- Cells valued **1–4 are redirect groups**, re-rolled at column `26 + value*5 +
  rand(5)`. A table therefore has a common section (columns 1–25) and four rarity
  buckets (26–50). `ITEM_DROP.STB` has 51 columns.
- `Get_DropITEM` returns false outright when the player is **10+ levels above** the
  monster, so lowering a monster's level can silently kill its drops.

---

## 3. What we can and cannot drop

**Resolved 2026-09-08: everything is droppable now.** The table below was the state
before the drop encoding was widened; it is kept because the *reason* still matters
when reading old tables.

| set | ids | droppable before | now |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jrose weapons (`project_jrose_weapon_import`) | 1381–1453 | **0 of 73** — all above 999 | **73 of 73** |
| Jrose back items (`project_jrose_back_import`) | 957–1061 | 43 of 105 (957–999 only) | **105 of 105** |
| Jrose shields (`project_jrose_subwpn_import`) | 308–342 | 35 of 35 | 35 of 35 |

`src/common/include/rose/common/drop_item_code.h` gives drop cells the same wide form
shops already had — `type * 100000 + id` above 999 — and the three readers now share
it. The ranges cannot collide (legacy tops out at 31,999), and **all 10,421 non-zero
cells in `ITEM_DROP.STB` decode bit-for-bit as before**; there were no wide cells and
the 1,039 sentinels are all legitimate 1–4 redirect groups.

The trap worth remembering: `CLIB_GameSRV::CheckSTB_DropITEM` runs at server start-up
and **zeroes** any cell whose type it cannot make sense of. A decoder ignorant of the
wide form would not merely skip a wide cell — it would delete it at load, so the table
would look fine on disk and be empty in memory. That is why the sanitiser is one of
the three sites, alongside `CCal::Get_DropITEM` and the Monster Inspector's list.

Ceiling is now the wire format, not the packing: `tagBaseITEM` is 5 bits of type and
**11** of item number, so ids up to 2047 drop.

The imported Jrose weapon sets **cannot be loot** without changing the cell encoding.
Options, in increasing order of cost: sell them from a Karkia NPC in stage 6 (free,
and stage 6 is coming anyway); make them quest rewards; or widen the drop encoding,
which touches shared client/server code and every existing table's meaning. **The
shop is the recommendation** — it also gives Karkia's NPCs a reason to exist.

**Resolved by stage 6d, and better than expected.** `Rose::Store::encode_store_item`
already has a **wide form** — `type * 100000 + no` for ids above 999 — supported by
the client, the server *and* the shop editor. So the shop route needed no encoding
work at all. Drops have since been given the same form (§3), so the wall is gone on
both sides.

`scripts/add-karkia-shops.py` sells two of the tiers and **reserves three for
drops**, chosen so Karkia never duplicates Oro (whose merchant Huzam sells 210 and
230 from tabs 5 and 6):

| tier | ids | where |
|---|---|---|
| lv215 "Mirere" (13, all weapon types) | 1381, 1384, 1387, 1390, 1393, 1396, 1399, 1402, 1405, 1408, 1411, 1414, 1417 | **shop** (Gelt) |
| lv225 (13, all weapon types) | 1382, 1385, 1388, 1391, 1394, 1397, 1400, 1403, 1406, 1409, 1412, 1415, 1418 | **shop** (Gelt) |
| lv220 (11) | 1426–1436 | **reserved for drops** |
| lv235 (10) | 1437–1446 | **reserved for drops** |
| lv240 (13, the mythical names) | 1383, 1386, 1389, 1392, 1395, 1398, 1401, 1404, 1407, 1410, 1413, 1416, 1419 | **reserved for drops** |

Left out of both: the partial lv210 set (1420–1425) duplicates Oro's tier, and the
low oddments (1447–1453, levels 150–205) sit far below Karkia's 215–240 band.

The lv240 set — Bahamut, Phoenix, Griffon, Unicorn, Albion, Quetzalcoatl, Aerie,
Catoblepas, Oberon, Mermaid, Spriggan, Giranda, Hellhound — is the crown tier and
belongs on the bosses (§4d), and **as of 2026-09-08 it can drop** — that was the last
thing blocked on the encoding. `add-karkia-shops.py --verify` proves none of the 34
reserved weapons has leaked into any shop tab.

## 4. The content plan

Three layers, in the order they should be authored.

### 4a. Materials as the backbone

The filler that stops a kill feeling empty, and it feeds crafting. Cheap, uses items
we already have, and it is what our own tables are mostly made of — our best live
endgame tables (940–942, ex-Moss Golem/Ant, level 200–210) run roughly **15–20
material cells to 4–8 use-item cells**, which is the ratio to copy.

Candidates already in `LIST_NATURAL`, at the tier Karkia sits in:

| | |
|---|---|
| metals | `12:8` Chromium, `12:9` Tiar, `12:10` Damascus, `12:16` Orihalcon, `12:17` Adamantium |
| woods | `12:37` Cinnamon, `12:38` Red Sandalwood, `12:39` Otherworldly, `12:40` Sephiroth |
| leathers | `12:47` Thick, `12:48` Hard, `12:49` Transparent, `12:50` Patterned |
| cloth | `12:59` Twill |

Karkia is a dead world of ruins and undead, so the flavour argument is for **metals,
leather and bone over wood** — Spire Village and the Cemetery should not read like a
forest. That is the one place to deviate from copying our existing tables wholesale.

### 4b. Use items as the reliable second layer

`10:13` Vital Water (XL), `10:32` Spiritual Water (XL), `10:157` HP Point (+1000),
`10:167` MP Point (+700), `10:171` Stamina. An endgame zone that funds its own
potion consumption is doing something useful even before the rare drops land.

### 4c. The imported Jrose sets as the signature drops

**This is the part that makes Karkia's loot feel like Karkia's.** The 35 shields
(`308–342`) and the 43 addressable back items (`957–999`) came from the same client
as Karkia itself, they are already in with art and stats — and **they currently have
no source anywhere in the game**. Karkia is where they should come from. It closes
`project_jrose_subwpn_import` and half of `project_jrose_back_import`.

Put them in the rarity buckets (columns 26–50), not the common section.

### 4d. Bosses

Each already has its own table (903–906). They should carry the best of §4c at a
much better rate, and are the natural home for anything we do not want in the field.

Note `NPC_DROP_MONEY` (`col 19`) is **0 across our entire game**, Karkia included —
nothing drops money today. Worth deciding deliberately rather than inheriting.

## 4e. Built — the numbers as shipped  *(DONE, 2026-09-08)*

`scripts/add-karkia-drops.py`. 9 tables + 2 zone mirrors, 11 rows written.

Measured by simulating `Get_DropITEM` faithfully over 600k kills per case, not
estimated:

| | Cemetery 900 (lv215-228) | Alphas 906 (lv228-240) | Boss 903 (lv240) |
|---|---|---|---|
| materials | 38.7% | 38.6% | 12.2% |
| use items | 7.3% | 3.8% | 3.8% |
| **shield** | **1 in 30** | **1 in 30** | 1 in 13 |
| **weapon** | **1 in 33** | **1 in 15** | **38%** (mythical) |
| money | 15.1% | 15.0% | 0% |
| nothing | 32.5% | 32.7% | 38.4% |

Three things worth keeping:

- **The zone rows 87 and 88 mirror 900 and 906.** `col 20` = 80 sends **20% of
  every roll to the row numbered after the zone**, so without the mirrors a fifth
  of all rolls hit an empty table and every rate above loses 20% — shields would
  be 1 in 37, not 1 in 30. This is the cheapest way to make the fallback harmless.
- **Money fires *instead of* an item**, so `col 19` is not free: at 15% it takes
  15% off the item rate. Bosses are set to **0** so it can never eat a mythical
  roll. A money drop pays ~2,000 z at lv215 and ~2,500 z at lv240; at 15% that is
  ~319 z/kill, so a 768,000 z shop weapon is ~2,400 kills. Raise `WORLD_VAR_DROP_M`
  (default 100) if that reads as too slow — it is a live GM-settable world var,
  not a table edit.
- **906 carries three redirects, not two**, so weapons run 1 in 15 there against
  1 in 33 in the Cemetery. Deliberate: it is the only cap-level farm and has twice
  the weapon pool (10 lv235 against 5 lv220).

**Both Drakes were bosses sharing a trash table** — 2729 pointed at 900 and 2699
at 906, so they dropped exactly what the mobs around them did. They now have rows
907 and 908.

Verified that `CLIB_GameSRV::CheckSTB_DropITEM` zeroes **nothing**: all 9,570
decodable cells in the whole table survive it, including the 66 new wide-encoded
weapon cells. That check matters because the sanitiser deletes what it cannot
parse rather than ignoring it.

The level gap does the rest of the work: a level-240 player gets **100% nothing**
from the Cemetery, which is what makes 906 the only cap farm rather than a
preference.

---

## 5. Oro has exactly the same problem

Not a Karkia-only defect, and worth doing in the same pass:

| | monsters | live drop table | empty table |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Karkia | 38 | 0 (wired, unfilled) | — |
| **Oro (lv 200+)** | 40 | **0** | **38** |
| Junon/Eldeon 150–199 | 100 | 59 | 33 |

Oro's monsters point at tables 773–851 and every one of them is empty, so Oro has
been running on its zone fallback since it was imported. **The whole endgame has no
authored loot tier** — Karkia just made it visible. Whatever shape §4 lands on should
be applied to Oro immediately after.

---

## 6. Open questions

- Should Karkia drop **our** endgame weapons (ids ≤ 999), or stay materials- and
  armour-flavoured so weapons stay a shop/quest reward?
- Money drops: leave at 0 like the rest of the game, or make Karkia the exception?
- The three placeholder zones (131/133/144) still spawn only a level-2 Jelly Bean
  (roadmap §4, decision 4). Their zone tables exist and are empty; leave them until
  the zones are populated.
