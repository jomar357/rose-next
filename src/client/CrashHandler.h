/// The client had no unhandled-exception filter and no minidump writer, so a
/// crash left nothing to work with: the engine log (`error.txt`) is buffered and
/// still ends at the *previous* run's "log: end.", and `client.log` simply stops
/// mid-line. Diagnosing anything meant re-running under cdb
/// (scripts/debug-client-crash.ps1) and reproducing on demand -- which does not
/// work for an intermittent fault, and changes frame timing enough that a race
/// may not reproduce at all.
///
/// Installing this makes the *next* crash capture itself during ordinary play:
///   <cwd>\crash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dmp   minidump, openable in WinDbg/VS
///   <cwd>\crash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt   one page: exception, faulting module+RVA,
///                                     registers, and both clocks for correlating
///                                     against client.log
///
/// Call once, as early in WinMain as possible. Configuration comes from
/// [LOG] CRASHDUMP in rose-next.ini (ROSE_CRASHDUMP overrides):
///   normal (default) - stacks, data segments, thread/handle data. Tens of MB.
///   full             - adds the entire address space. Hundreds of MB; use when
///                      a normal dump did not carry the memory you needed.
///   off              - do not install the filter at all.
