/// How a cell in ITEM_DROP.STB names an item.
///
/// Drop cells use **the same packing as shop slots** (see store_item_code.h):
/// `type * 1000 + id` for ids up to 999, and the wide `type * 100000 + id`
/// above that. What differs is not the packing but the sentinels a drop cell
/// can carry, which is why this is a separate header rather than a second use
/// of `Rose::Store`:
///
///     0            empty cell
///     1 .. 4       *redirect group* -- re-roll in column 26 + n*5 + rand(5)
///     5 .. 1000    junk; retail's own loader zeroes these
///     > 1000       a packed item, legacy or wide
///
/// The ranges cannot collide. The legacy form tops out at
/// `ITEM_TYPE_MONEY * 1000 + 999` = 31,999, so anything at or above
/// `Rose::Store::kWideBase` is unambiguously wide, and every drop cell that
/// exists today keeps decoding exactly as it did.
///
/// Widening matters because the imported Jrose weapon sets sit at ids
/// 1381-1453. Under the legacy packing alone they can never drop: 8 * 1000 +
/// 1381 = 9381, which decodes as type 9 id 381, a subweapon. Shops escaped
/// this in store_item_code.h; drops did not, so the best items Karkia owns had
/// no way to reach a loot table. Nothing on the wire limits them --
/// `tagBaseITEM` stores the type in 5 bits and the item number in **11**
/// (0..2047).
///
/// **This header exists so the three readers cannot drift.** A drop cell is
/// decoded in `CCal::Get_DropITEM` (the authority, common/), in
/// `CLIB_GameSRV::CheckSTB_DropITEM` (the server's start-up sanitiser, which
/// *zeroes* cells it cannot make sense of -- so a decoder that does not know
/// the wide form does not merely ignore a wide cell, it deletes it) and in
/// `CMonsterInspectorPanel` (the client's drop-list display). Do not inline a
/// copy of this logic at any of them.
///
/// Validity is deliberately *not* decided here, exactly as in the store
/// header: the callers check the type range and the id against the real STB
/// row count. This only splits the packed integer.
