"""Import the Karkia planet (9 zones) from the Jrose client.

Karkia is Jrose's late-era undead planet -- a cemetery, an overrun village, a
burned forest, a tower and a memory-realm cluster. `doc/karkia-survey.md` is the
evidence that it is importable; `doc/karkia-roadmap.md` is the plan this script
implements. Read the roadmap before changing anything here.

Staged the same way as `scripts/import-oro.py`, and for the same reason -- each
stage is independently testable in game and independently revertible:

    --stage 1   terrain, art, zone rows, zone names. No NPCs, no monsters, no
                gates: the copied .IFOs get their MOB/REGEN/WARP/EVENT_OBJECT
                lumps emptied on the way in (count = 0, lump table untouched),
                so later stages just refill them.
    --stage 2   the internal warp gates: WARP.STB rows and the gate objects put
                back into the .IFO WARP lumps. The way *in* is a separate
                script, scripts/add-karkia-travel.py.
    --stage 3   monsters: 38 LIST_NPC rows at their native ids, names, AI rows
                and .aip files, character models/skeletons/motions/effects with
                the usual index remap, mob-weapon presentation, and the spawn
                lumps. Stats are copied as Jrose wrote them; re-deriving them
                for our curve is stage 4.

Stages 4-6 (the balance pass, drops, NPCs) are planned in the roadmap and not
written yet.

Every stage is idempotent -- re-running detects what is already in place and does
nothing. --dry-run previews. --selftest proves every writer round-trips
byte-identically before anything is touched.

Why this is a *port* and not a copy
-----------------------------------
The container formats are unchanged (all 9 .ZON, 111 .IFO and 18 .ZSC parse with
the readers already in import-oro.py, and not one referenced asset is missing),
which is what makes stage 1 cheap. Five things still do not travel:

  * **Karkia's .ZON files are the stripped late-Jrose variant**: a 28-byte block 0
    and *no* LUMP_ECONOMY. The client does not care -- ReadZoneINFO reads exactly
    28 bytes -- but the server does. CZoneFILE::ReadECONOMY is the only caller of
    CEconomy::Load, so with no lump 4 it never runs, and CEconomy::Init then
    computes `m_iTownITEM[nP] = m_nTown_CONSUM[nP] * 100` off uninitialised heap.
    Not fatal (m_btItemRATE is clamped to 45..65) but the zone's shop prices would
    be driven by garbage. Every one of our own 55 zones has a lump 4, so this
    script splices one in -- see zon_with_economy().

  * **WARP.STB 170 and 172 are live Oro gates** here (TOWN->ODE01 and
    ODRP01->ODE01). Karkia uses those ids for Cemetery->Church and
    Cemetery->SpireVil. Nothing in stage 1 writes WARP.STB, but stage 2 must
    renumber rather than copy, or Muris breaks silently.

  * **LIST_ZONE_S.STL key LZON086 is our zone 82** (Gates of Muris), and Karkia's
    zone 86 asks for exactly that key. Fresh keys are allocated here (LZON091+,
    the first free block above our highest) and the English names are authored --
    the source strings are Japanese and our STL is the modern ITST01 dialect with
    five language blocks against Jrose's legacy I_NUM.

  * **Our .dds files are the better copies.** 331 of the textures Karkia shares
    with us differ only in that ours carry mip chains (mips=9 against mips=0) --
    we ran add-dds-mipmaps.py over them. copy_new() never overwrites, which makes
    that safe by construction; the *new* textures want the same treatment, so the
    run ends by listing them.

  * `LIST_SKY` row 17 does not exist here (we have 13 rows). Four Karkia zones
    reference it. It is copied along with the two LUNAR\\Sky02 textures.

Deliberately not done in stage 1: the entrance. Karkia has no gate from anywhere
in the game, and its nine zones split into two disconnected clusters plus an
isolated Tower -- that is stage 2's Wayfinder NPC. Reach the zones with a GM warp
until then.

After running: rebake the client VFS and restart the servers (they cache STBs at
startup).

File formats this script writes are documented at their reader/writer functions,
or in import-oro.py where they are shared.

#
# 31 spawned plus 7 that exist only as AI summons, at their **native ids**. All 38
# are free in our LIST_NPC (our last occupied row is 2265), and keeping the source
# numbering is what makes the .aip summon references resolve with no binary
# patching -- ks_2699 summons 2685 and 2686 by id.
#
# The names are authored. Jrose's LIST_NPC_S.STL is the legacy I_NUM dialect with
# no language blocks and Japanese text, so there is nothing to copy; these are
# translations, cross-checked against the .aip filenames where those name the
# creature (kak_spider -> Murilo, kak_neggolem -> Neg Golem, kak_deadeye -> Evil
# Eye, kak_melt -> Melt Qualle).
#
# Two deliberate choices worth knowing:
#   * The "D=" prefix is CANON and the "=" is load-bearing. Jrose's own
#     player-facing rows spell it that way (`D=シード`, `Ｄ＝エラー`), and a
#     translated line of dialog quotes it directly: "So every monster with 'D='
#     in its name is a victim of the Devil Pest." These names were first authored
#     with a hyphen, which silently broke that line -- the player was told to look
#     for a prefix no monster had. Corrected 2026-09-08; do not "tidy" it back to
#     a hyphen.
#   * 2701 and 2702 both come out "D=Victim". They are separate rows at different
#     levels whose only distinguishing text is the *editor* label (2701 is
#     "transformed villager", 2702 "maddened infected"), and the in-game name is
#     the same in the source. Kept faithful rather than invented; our own data
#     already ships three zones called "The Golden Ring", and 186 names in
#     LIST_NPC are shared by more than one row (Candle Ghost x32).
#   * The Spire Village roster is the Cemetery roster again +14 levels with an
#     alpha suffix, so it gets " Alpha". That suffix is **also canon**: the
#     source rows carry only dev placeholders (`KSヴィクティムf`), but the
#     dialog names the creatures directly -- `D=ヴィクティムα`, `蘇った防疫団員α`
#     -- so " Alpha" is what the quest text tells the player to hunt. Re-theming
#     the set would desynchronise those lines; the open roadmap question is the
#     shared *art*, not the names.
#   * A few are transliteration guesses with no established English: Murilo,
#     Orgeid, Eugeid, Melt Qualle, Woodnoid.

    # and never assigned a monster to any of them -- their own files carry id 1
    # in every slot -- so which creatures live here is authored, not restored.

#
#   Hitted(iEffectIDX) -> EFFECT_HITTED_NORMAL(I) = g_TblEFFECT.get_int32(I, 9),
#     and g_TblEFFECT is LIST_EFFECT.STB. So the impact effect is a **LIST_EFFECT**
#     row whose col 9 is the FILE_EFFECT index. Fed by LIST_WEAPON 38/39.
#   ShowEffectOnCharByIndex -> Add_EffectWithIDX, bounds-checked against
#     CEffectLIST, which cgame.cpp builds from **FILE_EFFECT.STB**. So the death
#     effect (LIST_NPC 34) is a FILE_EFFECT row.
#
# The trap that produced the reported bug: cobjchar_actionframe.cpp case 21/31
# falls back to the NPC's own columns (33 hand-hit effect, 31 attack sound) *only

# 1090 Tornado, on the Revived Quarantine Officer (2703) and its Alpha (2692).
#   Reported in game as damage with no animation and no visible cast, and a run of
#   "blank hits" ending in a death. The rates say the report is not bad luck:
#   kak_livingdead.aip has a damaged-rate of *100%*, so 2703 rolled this on 10% of
#   every hit it took. Adding the missing casting/skill anim pair (a86dbbff) fixed
#   the monster's animation but evidently not the skill's own presentation.
#
#   The likely reason it is this skill and not the others: 1090 is one of only two
#   *re-pointed* skills (SKILL_REPOINT), i.e. one of OUR player skills handed to a
#   monster, rather than a row ported from Jrose. Its sibling 361 Berserk is a
#   self-buff and shows its own effect, so it looks fine; an AoE damage skill has to
#   present a hit on a target it was never authored to reach. Left as a known
#   unknown rather than chased -- removing it costs one AI action on one monster.
#
# NOT disabled, for contrast: 3613 Karkia Stun on Murilo (2715/2696) was also never
# seen in game, but that one is fully explained without a defect -- 35% damaged-rate
# x a 10% roll x "target has no harmful status" is ~3.5% of hits taken, and its
# motion pair (8/9) is verified present on both casters. It is a ported row, not a
# re-pointed player skill. Add 3613 here if it turns out to misbehave too.

#
# **Empty on purpose since 2026-09-12.** KSPIREVIL used to sit here at 0.25, sized
# against a 200 m bodies-and-mesh-draws model that counted a point as one monster.
# It is four (see regen_set_tacticpoint), so that model -- and every density number
# in doc/karkia-roadmap.md -- was 4x low, which is why a 75% cut still played as a
# wall. Both main maps now go through SPAWN_CAMPS below, which merges neighbouring
# points instead of deleting them and so cannot lose a species. Thinning stays
# available for a zone whose density genuinely *is* its point count.
SPAWN_THINNING = {}

# Camp consolidation, for the two main maps: folder -> (grid cell in cm, camp size).
#
# These two zones are a *carpet* -- one regen point per monster, points ~5 m
# apart, 847 of them in the Cemetery and 1,111 in Spire Village. Thinning alone
# is the wrong lever for them, for two reasons found on 2026-09-12:
#
# 1. **Every point is single-species.** All five basic slots and both tactics
#    slots of every one of those 1,958 points hold the *same* npc id. So the
#    escalation machine buys nothing, and the only thing that makes the zone
#    varied is which points happen to be near you -- which means deleting points
#    deletes species. thin_regen is greedy on nearest-neighbour distance and
#    completely species-blind: at 15% keep it drops Evil Fairy, Orgeid and D=Seed
#    out of the Cemetery entirely.
#
# 2. **Each point holds four monsters, not one.** See regen_set_tacticpoint --
#    tacticPoint 1 puts the very first tick in the top branch of the table.
#
# So instead of deleting points we *merge* them. Bin the zone on a grid, keep one
# record per bin, and give it the species of everything that bin absorbed: the
# result is one camp where there were six or seven singles, holding a mix rather
# than a clone. Population falls because the bin's 6-7 points become one point of
# five bodies; diversity *rises* because 85% of the camps come out multi-species
# where every source point was single-species.
#
# Measured against the Jrose source with CRegenPOINT::Proc's real branch table:
#
#              camps  bodies   was   per 100m cell   vs JG07   camp gap   species
#   KCEMETERY    113     565  3,388       8.8         0.27x     38.8 m     21/21
#   KSPIREVIL     77     385  1,109      12.4         0.39x     37.8 m     10/10
#
# JG07, our densest field zone, is 32.2 bodies per cell. The ~38 m median gap
# between camps sits well outside the 13-22 m aggro radii the Karkia .aip files
# declare, so a pull is one camp of five.
#
# KSPIREVIL used to carry SPAWN_THINNING 0.25 (1,111 -> 278 points). That is gone:
# consolidation supersedes it and running both would cut twice. thin_regen itself
# stays -- it is still the right lever for a zone whose density really is its
# point count.

# What a consolidated camp gets written with. interval paces the escalation as

# cleared camp is back in ~100 s. Jrose ran these maps at 20-565 s; JG07 runs
# 5-12 s; Eldeon EZ01 runs 30-40 s.
CAMP_INTERVAL = 20

# Which monsters a zone's regen points actually spawn, as
#   folder -> (basic [(npc, count), ...], tactics [(npc, count), ...])
#
# Jrose laid out 53 regen points across these three zones and put **id 1 in
# every slot** -- their own files, not our import -- so nothing here is being
# restored. Every point carries five basic slots and two tactics slots with a
# concurrent cap of seven, and the tactics list is the escalation set: it comes
# out once the point's tactic points build up, which makes it the right home for
# an elite. Unused slots are written as id 0, which the loader skips.
#
# This lives in stage 3 for the same reason SPAWN_THINNING does: the stage
# rebuilds every REGEN lump from Jrose's source on each run, so an
# after-the-fact edit would be silently undone by the next --stage 3.
#
# The rosters come from what the NPCs ask for, which is the only authority there
# is now that the source slots are empty:
#   Memories  -- Pormello's ecology quests name Melitta, Melan Melitta and
#                Calaplasinos, and a swarm with a queen behind it.
#   Garden    -- Nitraria collects leaves from Mukuroji, Nigaki and Beeberu.
#   Burned Forest is NOT a flashback zone: its gates run to and from the
#                Cemetery, so it is present-day Karkia and gets present-day
#                monsters. The Church's own timber request names Woodnoids and
#                Dark Towers, which is exactly a burned forest's roster.
# Concurrent-alive cap (CRegenPOINT m_iLimitCNT) to force onto every regen point
# in a zone. None means "leave Jrose's".
#
# This is the lever these three zones need, and SPAWN_THINNING is not. Karkia's
# main zones are built as **many points at cap 1** -- the Cemetery is 847 points
# holding 847 monsters -- while the flashback zones are **few points at cap
# 10-15**: 23 points holding 265 in the Burned Forest. Each point is therefore a
# nest that refills up to fifteen bodies into a 10 m radius on a 60 s timer, and
# the maps are small enough (Memories' whole population fits inside one 200 m
# view) that there is nowhere to stand that is not inside one.
#
# Measured as monsters per 100 m cell against JG07, our densest field zone:
# Burned Forest and Memories both sat at 0.66x and the Garden at 0.61x, which
# looks reasonable until you notice Memories spends all of it in five cells
# where JG07 spreads over twenty-six. Capping at 5 lands them near 0.3x, which
# is where Spire Village ended up after its 75% thin -- the density already
# signed off as "much better, still an invasion feeling".

# than retail Junon's 5-25s. The interval is not just respawn speed: a point
# advances *one step* of its escalation per tick (see SPAWN_ROSTER below), so
# at 120s the second monster species in a nest is two minutes behind the first
# and the fifth is ten.
SPAWN_INTERVAL = {"KMEMORIES": 15, "KFLOWERGARDEN": 15, "KBURNEDFOREST": 15}

# returns early doing nothing at all while liveCNT >= limitCNT. Shipping count 5
# against a cap of 5 meant slot 0 alone filled the point exactly on the first
# tick, so slots 1-4 were unreachable until a player cleared the nest by hand.
# In game that read as "the zone only has Woodnoids", then Dark Towers after you
# killed them, then Evil Fairies -- one species at a time, forever.
#
# Retail is the model: JG01's points run counts of 1-2 against caps of 2-13. At
# count 1 and cap 5 a point fills to four species in five ticks and holds the
# same five bodies it held before, so this costs no density.

    dense as it started.

    Bin on a `cell_cm` grid, keep one record per bin, and give that record the
    species of everything the bin absorbed. The survivor is the point nearest the

    camp on tick one and the rest are unreachable until a player clears it by hand.

    Points that are not part of the carpet are passed through untouched --
    anything already on a non-1 tacticPoint was authored deliberately (Spire
    Village's lone Deadly Drake Alpha point, tacticPoint 100 / interval 900 s /
