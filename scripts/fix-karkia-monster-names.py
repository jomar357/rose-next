"""Re-sync Karkia's monster names from `import-karkia.py`'s KARKIA_MONSTERS.

Written for one specific defect and kept as a general tool.

--- the defect

The Devil Pest monsters were authored as **`D-Victim`, `D-Ghoul Ein`, `D-Seed`**
and so on. The source spells that prefix with an **equals sign**, not a hyphen --
Jrose's own player-facing rows are `D=シード` and `Ｄ＝エラー` -- and one line of
dialog we shipped in stage 6c quotes it directly:

    "So every monster with 'D=' in its name is a victim of the Devil Pest."

which the Field Medic says while standing next to twelve monsters whose names all
began with a hyphen. The player was told to look for a prefix that appeared
nowhere in the game. Ten more lines name `D=Seed`, `D=Victim`, `D=Error`,
`D=Ghoul` and `D=Alma Core` the same way, several of them as hunt instructions.

So this is not a re-theme; it is one character, twelve rows, restoring agreement
between the monsters and the text that explains them.

--- two things deliberately NOT changed

**The " Alpha" suffix stays.** It looks like filler -- the ten Spire Village
monsters are the Cemetery roster again, same art, +13 levels -- but it is canon:
the source rows carry only *dev placeholders* (`KSヴィクティムf`), while the
dialog names the creatures outright as `D=ヴィクティムα` and `蘇った防疫団員α`,
and two quests tell the player to kill thirty of each by that name. Renaming them
would desynchronise those lines. What is genuinely open is the shared **art**, not
the names.

**`D=Victim` on both 2701 and 2702 stays.** Two rows, one name, and that is
normal here: 186 names in `LIST_NPC` are used by more than one row (Candle Ghost
by 32 of them). The source distinguishes them only by an editor label.

--- why a separate script

Correcting `KARKIA_MONSTERS` alone changes nothing on disk. `import-karkia.py`
stage 3 writes a name only into a row it is creating -- `if our_npc.occupied(i):
continue`, and the STL likewise `if our_stl.has(key): continue` -- which is what
makes re-running it safe for the balance passes, and also what makes it unable to
ever *revise* a name. This pass writes names and nothing else, so it can be run
against live, rebalanced data without touching a single stat.

--- both sides, always

A monster's name is stored twice and read by different processes:

    server   NPC_NAME(I) -> g_TblNPC.get_cstr(I, 0)          LIST_NPC.STB col 0
    client   NPC_NAME(I) -> CStringManager::GetNpcName(I)    LIST_NPC_S.STL,
                            keyed by NPC_STRING_ID = col 40

Writing only the STB renames it for the server -- GM tools, logs, `/item`-style
lookups -- while every player still reads the old name, and nothing warns you.

Idempotent. `--dry-run` / `--verify` / `--restore`. The sidecar goes to build/,
never beside the data: `pack.rs` walks the data tree filtering only *hidden*
entries, so a stray file in `data/3DDATA/STB` is baked into the `.vfs`.

After running: restart the servers (they cache STBs at startup) and re-bake the
client VFS.
