"""Give shipped DDS textures a real mip chain, so the client stops building one at runtime.

WHY
---
Character-spawn hitches were fixed first (see the motion-parser change in
zz_motion::load); what remained were 20-140 ms frames whose entire cost was
`shadow` -> immediate flush -> D3DXCreateTextureFromFileInMemoryEx. Splitting
that call showed the file read is ~0.1 ms per texture and the *create* is
everything else, at anywhere between 0.20 ms and 11.13 ms for a single
texture -- a 55x spread, so not a fixed overhead.

zz_renderer_d3d.cpp carries a note from the original team explaining it:

    512x512 texture
    DXT1 - miplevel1 = 0.729ms, 131KB
    DXT1 - miplevel2 = 57ms, 131KB

Same file, same size. The cost is D3DX *generating* a mip chain rather than
copying the file's, which for a DXT source means decompress, box-filter and
recompress for every level. No D3DXCreateTextureFromFileInMemoryEx flag avoids
the recompress, so this cannot be tuned away in the renderer.

data/SCRIPTS/INIT.LUA asks for 3 mip levels via setMipmapLevel(3), and that cap
is load-bearing -- object lightmaps are a gutterless atlas and a deeper chain
would bleed between neighbouring cells (see the root CLAUDE.md). Taking 3 levels
from a file that ships its own chain is a cheap copy. Building 3 levels for a
file that ships none is the expensive path, and it is pure waste: the same work,
on every client, on every load, forever.

An in-game capture settled it beyond correlation. Every slow create logged by
"r_d3d: slow texture create" -- 196 of 196, no exceptions -- had src_mips=1,
costing 1300 ms in one short session across 163 distinct files.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Rewrites every DDS under data/ that has no mip chain, adding a full one and
keeping the pixel format, the dimensions and the legacy DX9 header. Files that
already have a chain are skipped, so re-running is a no-op and safe.

Object lightmaps are excluded by default (see is_excluded). `--lightmaps` opts
them in, capped at LIGHTMAP_MIPS levels; `--selftest` measures whether the filter
can bleed across an atlas cell boundary before any data is touched.

RUNS ON RECORD (data/ is gitignored, so this list is the only committed history)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The original pass: 419 non-lightmap textures across data/.
- 2026-09-07, `--subdir 3DDATA/MAPS/KARKIA --lightmaps`: 282 Karkia lightmaps,
  42.7 -> 56.1 MB (+13.3 MB, +31%). Karkia's lightmaps are the only ones in the
  game that reach 2048 px, at 100.6 ms each to build at load; they were 8,711 ms
  of the 8,747 ms of slow texture creates Karkia logged. Its *other* textures were
  already fine from the original pass -- only 33 ms remained. Oro's 354 lightmaps
  were left alone on purpose, to keep the first lightmap run easy to clean up;
  they are 32-512 px and cost ~1.0 s in total.
  Undo exactly this run with
  `--subdir 3DDATA/MAPS/KARKIA --restore-excluded`.
- 2026-09-08, full pass: **31 files**, all that remained in data/ without a chain.
  29 are NPC textures that arrived *after* the original pass (the Karkia and Oro
  imports: karkia, dark_drake, stony, orobaba, oro_seto, ronwea_black, dark_ent,
  LICH01/02, MUMMY_FEMALE02, zorg_egg, KUPER) plus one avatar cap and one
  particle texture. Every entry in a fresh in-game log with `src_mips=1` is in
  this set. **What is left in that log is not fixable this way**: the 2048 px
  Karkia lightmaps already carry `src_mips=3 req_mips=3` and are simply large,
  and `LUNAR/Sky02/DAY01.DDS` + `NIGHT01.DDS` are 1024x1024 **uncompressed** with a full
  11-level chain -- 5.5 MB each, so their cost is raw size, not mip generation.
  Compressing a smooth sky gradient to DXT is exactly where banding shows, and
  they load once per zone, so they were left alone deliberately.

- 2026-09-08, `--subdir 3DDATA/AVATAR/{CAP,BODY,ARMS,FOOT}`: **106 files**, every
  texture the four armour imports of that day brought in (Egyptian lv240, Steam
  lv220, Refined Steam lv225, Unit Core lv230). 3.85 -> 4.59 MB (+0.74 MB, +19%).
  A fresh in-game log had 14 distinct `src_mips=1` armour textures at ~3 ms each;
  the other colours are the same files and would have logged the same on first
  wear. Scoped per folder rather than run whole because the ask was to touch only
  the armour -- though a check first proved the two sets were identical: every DDS
  under `AVATAR/{ARMS,BODY,CAP,FOOT}` without a chain came from those imports, and
  nothing else in `data/` was left un-mipped.

  Verified independently of this script's own check, by decoding pixels with
  Pillow and comparing against the pre-conversion backups: worst mip-0 deviation
  **1.69/255** (DXT1 re-encode noise, unavoidable and invisible) and worst
  generated-mip deviation **0.00/255** against a BOX resize computed outside
  texconv, over 120 files. For scale, the WIC darkening `-nowic` exists to prevent
  measured 36% and 71%, i.e. ~92 and ~181 out of 255. The black-band failure mode
  is three orders of magnitude away, measured rather than argued.

Uses thirdparty/directxtex-2020.9.30/texconv.exe, which was already vendored in
this repo and used by nothing at all.

TRAPS
-----
- **-dx9 is mandatory.** DirectXTex defaults to writing a "DX10" extended DDS
  header for some formats, and the client's D3DX9 loader cannot read those. A
  converted file would simply fail to load, and the engine's degrade-not-die
  path would draw the object untextured rather than tell you why. --verify
  rejects a DX10 header explicitly for that reason.
- **Backups go outside data/.** src/pipeline/src/pack.rs walks the data tree
  filtering only *hidden* entries -- there is no extension filter -- so a .bak
  left beside a texture gets baked into the .vfs. They go to
  build/dds-mipmap-backup/ instead.
- **-nowic is mandatory, and this one shipped a visible bug before it was found.**
  texconv filters through the Windows Imaging Component by default, and WIC
  darkens RGB badly when downsampling these textures -- measured at 36% on a
  terrain tile and 71% on an NPC body, with the alpha channel untouched. Only the
  lower mips are affected, so on screen it is a black wash that appears at
  distance and clears as you walk in. -if TRIANGLE also happens to avoid it, but
  only because WIC has no triangle filter and silently falls back to the same
  code path; -nowic is the flag that actually says what is meant. -if BOX on top
  matches what D3DX generated at runtime before any of this, keeping the visual
  result as close to the old behaviour as possible.
- **DirectXTex's own mip generator is power-of-two only** and returns
  E_FAIL [mipmaps] otherwise, so NPOT textures are skipped. No loss: they are
  minimaps, UI resources and effect strips, and the engine forces miplevels=1 for
  image textures regardless (zz_renderer_d3d download_texture, get_for_image()).
- **--verify samples decoded mip brightness, not just its presence.** The first
  version of this script checked dimensions, format and mip count, passed
  cleanly, and shipped chains that were 36-71% too dark. "The mips exist" and
  "the mips are correct" are different claims, and a verifier that cannot fail
  the actual defect is decoration. Needs Pillow; it says so when it cannot check.
- **Re-encoding a DXT file is lossy.** The top level is decompressed and
  recompressed, so the result is not bit-identical to the original. BC1/2/3
  endpoint selection is near-idempotent in practice, but this is why --restore
  exists.
- **The lightmap exclusion rested on a filter claim, and the claim is testable.**
  It named texconv's *default FANT filter, whose support reaches past one texel*
  -- but this script has passed `-if BOX` since the WIC fix. `--selftest` measures
  it on the worst geometry we ship (2048 px atlas, 8x8 grid of 256 px cells):
  BOX 0/255, FANT 0/255, TRIANGLE 36/255. A strict 2x2 box cannot cross a cell
  boundary while the cell stays even (256 -> 128 -> 64). Note also that the
  symptom which prompted the exclusion -- a dark wash at distance that clears as
  you walk in -- is the same symptom the -nowic trap above describes, and -nowic
  is what fixed that one. Lightmaps stay off by default anyway; the cap at
  LIGHTMAP_MIPS is what makes opting in safe rather than merely untested, since
  it leaves no level deeper than the engine loads for display quality 3-4 to
  reach.
- **A full chain is roughly a third larger.** The no-mip files total ~194 MB, so
  expect ~65 MB of growth. rose.vfs has a hard 2 GB limit whose failure mode is
  silent and extremely confusing (see the root CLAUDE.md), so re-check the
  archive size after the next bake.
- Since data/ is gitignored, this docstring is the only committed record of the
  change. Put new reasoning here, not just in a commit message.

    Object lightmaps are a **gutterless atlas**: each map-object part owns one
    cell of a shared texture and SetLightMap addresses it with a UV transform, so
    there is no padding between cells and a filter that knows nothing about the
    grid blends a part's lighting into its neighbours'. The root CLAUDE.md spells
    this out and says a full chain is unsafe for them.

    That was the original reasoning, and it named texconv's *default FANT filter,
    whose support reaches past one texel*. This script has passed `-if BOX` since
    the WIC fix, and --selftest measures the actual claim on the worst geometry we
    ship (a 2048 px atlas of 256 px cells): BOX and FANT both bleed **0/255** at
    the 3 levels the engine loads, while TRIANGLE bleeds 36/255. A strict 2x2 box
    cannot cross a cell boundary, because every block it averages lies wholly
    inside one cell as long as the cell stays even -- 256 -> 128 -> 64 here.

    Worth knowing when weighing this: the symptom that prompted the exclusion (a
    dark wash at distance that clears as you walk in) is the same symptom the
    -nowic trap above describes, and -nowic is what fixed that one. The exclusion
    may have been treating a bug that a different flag had already solved.

    So lightmaps are still excluded by default -- the conservative choice, and it
    keeps --restore-excluded working as a one-command undo for exactly this set --
    but --lightmaps opts them in, capped at LIGHTMAP_MIPS levels so nothing deeper
    than the engine loads even exists to be reached by a higher quality setting.

    The premise that made the blanket exclusion cheap was "these are 32-512 px
    textures and contribute almost nothing to load cost". That held for Junon and
    Oro. It does not hold for Karkia, whose lightmaps run to 2048 px -- 16x the
    area -- at 100.6 ms each to build at load, and which account for 8,711 ms of
    Karkia's 8,747 ms of logged slow texture creates.
