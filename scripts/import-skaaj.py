"""Import Skaaj, Jrose's cat-folk island town, as our zone 89.

Skaaj (スカ, "Ska") is Jrose zone 79: a small tropical island -- a plaza on the
southern islet, a bridge north to a ranch and a pool, open sea all round -- that
Jrose used as the hub of its housing and pet systems. We want the map, the
townsfolk and the way there; not the housing, the pet shop or the cooking chain.
Nothing hostile lives on it: the only spawns are butterflies and clownfish.

Staged like scripts/import-karkia.py, and for the same reason -- each stage is
independently testable in game and re-runnable:

    --stage 1   terrain, art, tiles, the zone row and its name. The copied .IFOs
                get their MOB/REGEN/WARP lumps emptied on the way in; the one
                warp gate led to Jrose's housing interior and is never refilled.
    --stage 2   the eleven townsfolk: LIST_NPC rows at their native ids, English
                names, character models, LIST_EVENT rows for their dialogs, the
                .CON files, and the placements back into the MOB lumps.
    --stage 3   the critters: three clownfish recolours (2785-2787) our table
                lacks, then the 21 regen points exactly as Jrose laid them out.
    --stage 4   dialog and travel: the "Skaaj language" switch, English text for
                every reachable line, Jrose-only options hidden, and the trips --
                Jones (Junon Polis) and Nova (Orlean Portal Temple) get a
                "take me to Skaaj" option, and Wedgy the island's travel guide
                sends you back to the Adventurer's Plains or Junon Polis.

Every stage is idempotent; --dry-run previews; --verify re-derives the state;
--selftest proves every writer round-trips byte-identically before anything is
touched.

Why this is a port and not a copy
---------------------------------
  * **Zone 79 is our Wasteland** (Oro), so Skaaj lands on 89, the first free row
    after Oro's block. Nothing in the map data encodes the number -- the tile
    folder is named `Skaaj\\79` but that is a path, and the revive-zone columns
    are blank -- so renumbering costs nothing. The STL key LZON079 is likewise
    taken; LZON100 is the first free above Karkia's block.

  * **The sky column is blank** in Jrose's row. The client reads it as an integer
    (blank = sky 0, the Junon day sky), but the xadet map editor rejects a blank
    cell outright, so we write an explicit 0.

  * **The .ZON is the stripped late-Jrose variant** with no LUMP_ECONOMY; without
    one the server's CEconomy runs on uninitialised heap. Spliced in exactly as
    import-karkia.py does it.

  * **The town is gated on a "language" quest switch.** Every NPC's real greeting
    sits behind `QF_checkQuestCondition("chk-Skaaj-Language-QSW")`, and the
    ungated line before it is cat-language ("nyaa nii onyaa..."). Miakis, the
    divine envoy, is the only one you understand; her dialog ends with a
    "Thank you!" that fires `Skaaj-Language-QSW-ON`, which sets quest switch 90,
    and from then on everyone speaks plainly. CEvent::Conversation walks every
    root node and each NPCSAY replaces the last, so the later gated line wins
    once the switch is on -- that is the whole mechanism, and it is kept. Switch
    90 is unused in our 225 QSD files, so the condition and reward entities are
    copied byte-for-byte from Jrose's QN-SKA001.QSD into our QP401.QSD.

  * **Four dialog options lean on Jrose systems we do not have** and call Lua
    functions our client never registered (GF_openDeliveryStore,
    GF_openSpotBank, GF_PetDepositOpen, GF_IsWorldName): the warehouse keeper's
    "my item center" and "withdraw-only storage", the rancher's "pet goods"
    (Jrose LIST_SELL 266, Jrose pet items) and "board my pet". A missing Lua
    function pops an ErrorBOX, so their check-function field is pointed at
    `TA_Hidden`, defined in a QEX1 appendix to return 0. Everything else the
    files call exists here: GF_openBank, GF_openStore, QF_doQuestTrigger,
    QF_findQuest, QF_getEventOwner.

  * **The cooking-chain, housing and TGS2015 branches do NOT simply never
    pass.** Their triggers are unknown here and fail, but several checks are
    inverted -- `TA_CookQ_Q32_10` ("your bag is full") returns 1 when
    `chk-Q32_INV` fails -- and the node's text is empty on our side. An NPCSAY
    with empty text closes the window *before* it tests the text, so Lusiga's
    greeting opened and was shut in the same tick and the bird read as mute
    (found in the client debug log, 2026-09-18). Every node gated on one of
    those chains (68 across the files, HIDE_CHECK_PREFIXES) is re-pointed at
    `TA_Hidden` as well.

  * **Wedgy's exits collide with ours by name.** His Lua fires
    `QF_doQuestTrigger("gotoJunon")` -- and a `gotoJunon` already exists in our
    TUTORIAL.QSD, since trigger names are global across every QSD -- and gates
    the Junon Polis option on `chk-clear-voyagequest` (Jrose's newbie voyage,
    quest switch 37, which *is* in use here for something else). Rather than
    patch bytecode, the QEX1 appendix on EM79-001 redefines the three functions:
    the appendix runs after the main blob in the same lua_State, so the later
    definition wins. Our triggers are `Skaaj-TravelToPlains` / `-ToJunon`, the
    same REWD_007 warps the Oro and Karkia travel scripts write, landing on
    each zone's own `start`, and the gate simply returns 1.

  * **Jrose NPC 1774 is dead on arrival**: no name, no LIST_NPC.CHR entry, and
    its placement asks for `EM79-012.con` while the file is `EM79-12.CON`. It
    is dropped rather than repaired.

  * **Our LIST_NPC.CHR carries orphan entries at 1753-1759** (a "noname" model
    582) with no LIST_NPC row behind them. import_characters keeps any entry it
    finds, so those slots are cleared first when the row is blank on our side,
    or the fisher would wear the wrong body.

After running: `add-dds-mipmaps.py --subdir 3DDATA/SKAAJ` and
`--subdir 3DDATA/TERRAIN/TILES/SKAAJ` (Jrose ships flat textures), delete the
`.bak` files the writers leave (pack.rs bakes them), rebake the VFS, restart the
servers. Stage 4's appended options need the QEX1-aware client, so ship client
and data together.
