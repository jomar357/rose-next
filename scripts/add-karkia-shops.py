"""Stage 6d: give Karkia working shops.

Karkia shipped six NPCs with shop tabs, and none of them sold anything useful:

  Gelt      4019  Spire Village      tab 585 -- past the end of LIST_SELL.STB
  Nemo      4142  Abandoned Church   tab 584 -- past the end of LIST_SELL.STB
  Belfa     4103  Foot of the Tower  tabs 478-481, shared with Crune
  Orentark  4104  Foot of the Tower  tabs 245/248, shared -- Materials, Dealer Skill
  Ginias    4089  Memories           tab 593 -- past the end of LIST_SELL.STB
  Astraea   4108  Memories           tab 594 -- past the end, *and* union-gated

Two findings shaped what this script does, both from reading the client rather
than from the tables:

**A shop only exists if the NPC's .CON calls `GF_openStore`.** Exactly three
Karkia conversations do it in the shipped data: EM86-001 (Nemo), EM86-013
(Gelt), EM02-114 (Orentark), EM03-002 (Ginias) and EM03-011 (Astraea). Belfa
did **not**, and was given one by `quest-editor con-store` (a QEX1 appendix)
in a later pass; his tabs are wired here. Sulfa (4017, EM86-011) is the same
case, added 2026-09-13 to sell the second lv230 armour set.

The two that still have no store call are recorded so nobody re-investigates
them:

  Ash        4088  EM03-001  calls only GF_openBank -- he is the Memories
                             *storagekeeper*, so a bank and no shop is correct.
                             He carries no tab and needs none.
  Bordeaux   4097  EM03-010  calls nothing at all. His four tabs (512-515) are
                             therefore inert exactly as Belfa's were: 512 is a
                             "Skill Book" row shared with Olleck, and 513-515
                             have no STL key and no stock. Giving him a shop
                             means a con-store append first; left alone
                             deliberately.

All three call `GF_openStore(owner, 0)`, and the client only draws the fourth
tab for `bSpecialTab = 1`. So **only LIST_NPC cols 21-23 are usable**; col 24
is written as 0.

**A shop NPC's union number lives in the drop-chance column.**
`NPC_UNION_NO(I)` is `#define`d to `NPC_DROP_ITEM(I)` -- game col 20, the same
cell that means "roll my own drop table" on a monster. Both `CStore::ChangeStore`
and the server's trade handler refuse the shop when that value is non-zero and
does not equal the player's union. Astraea shipped with **20**, and
`CObjAVT::SetCur_UNION` rejects anything `>= MAX_UNION_COUNT` (10) while the DB
column defaults to 0 -- so no player can ever hold union 20 and her shop was
shut for everyone, whatever her tab pointed at. She is the only Karkia NPC with
a non-zero union; this script clears it. Note only tabs 0-2 (cols 21-23) are
gated by nothing else: `ChangeStore` always draws them and reads col 24 only
for `openStore(npc, 1)`.

**A dangling tab row is safe but blank.** `STBDATA::value` bounds-checks the
flat index and returns a default, so rows 584/585 read as empty rather than
out of bounds -- an empty nameless tab, not a crash. (Note the client's
`CStringManager::GetStoreTabName` guards with `iIndex > row_count`, an
off-by-one that lets `iIndex == row_count` through; harmless for the same
reason, but it is a real off-by-one.)

Rather than pad LIST_SELL out to row 585 with 22 dead rows, this appends four
rows at 561-564 and repoints the two NPCs onto them.

--- what is sold, and why

`Rose::Store::encode_store_item` has a **wide form** -- `type * 100000 + no`
for ids above 999 -- supported by the client, the server and the shop editor.
That is what makes the imported Jrose weapons sellable at all: at ids 1381-1453
they are unreachable through the legacy `type * 1000 + no` packing, the same
wall that stops them ever dropping (see doc/project-drops.md).

None of the 73 imported weapons is sold anywhere today, so all of them are
Karkia-exclusive by construction. They fall into clean level tiers, and Oro's
weapon merchant (Huzam, tabs 5 and 6) already occupies 210 and 230:

    Oro sells        210, 230
    Karkia sells     215, 225      <- this script
    Karkia drops     220, 235, 240 <- reserved, doc/project-drops.md

The level-240 set is the mythical-name tier (Bahamut, Phoenix, Griffon,
Unicorn, Albion, Quetzalcoatl, ...) and is deliberately left for drops, as are
220 and 235. Two tiers left over are used by neither: the partial level-210 set
(1420-1425) duplicates Oro's tier, and the low oddments (1447-1453, levels
150-205) sit far below Karkia's 215-240 band.

Requirements are on our own scale, not inflated -- our level-230 Viper weapons
already ask STR 335-365, and the level-215 tier here asks 277-321.

Astraea, Karkia's armourer, sells the **materials** her own dialog asks for --
Memories became reachable in stage 7a and stage 8 imported them, so she is the one
NPC in the game for whom that stock was already written into her lines.

She also sells the **armour**, in her two remaining tab columns: the level-225
Refined Steam and level-230 Unit Core tiers, 16 items each. She is the only armour
seller Karkia has -- the [Starsteel Armourer], and the only NPC there whose `.CON`
opens a store *and* whose role fits -- so there is nothing to split across. The
level-240 Egyptian tier is deliberately **not** sold: it is the cap tier and is
reserved for loot, the same split the weapons use.

Both armour tabs are laid out as a grid rather than poured in from slot 0, matching
Muris' Azim: **one set per column, one body part per row** -- cap over body over
gloves over boots, classes left to right. A tab is 8 columns x 6 rows and the client
places each icon at its slot index, so pouring 16 items in sequentially would run all
four caps along the top row and wrap each set across a line break.

Idempotent. `--dry-run` / `--verify` / `--restore`. Backups go to build/, never
beside the data: src/pipeline/src/pack.rs walks the data tree filtering only
*hidden* entries -- no extension filter -- so a .bak in data/3DDATA/STB gets
baked into the .vfs.

After running: restart the servers (they cache STBs at startup) and re-bake the
client VFS.
