"""Import the 667 "Egyptian" armour as our level-240 tier -- the first full set
above Crystal, and the first armour import this project has done.

Sixteen items: four class lines x four slots, appended to `LIST_CAP`,
`LIST_BODY`, `LIST_ARMS` and `LIST_FOOT`.

--- why this set, out of thousands

Surveyed by *texture signature* rather than by name, because the names lie in
both directions and each lie costs a wasted import:

* **667 looks like it has seven level-240 sets** -- Brave, Courage, Luminous,
  Precious, Glorious, Chivalrous and a base grade. All seven point at the **same
  mesh and the same textures** (`body1_egyptian_soldier01.ZMS` seven times).
  They are stat tiers over one look, so this is one set, not seven. Grade
  "Brave" is taken arbitrarily; any of the seven would give identical art.
* **Jrose's obvious candidate is art we already ship.** Its level 190-199 band
  carries a handsome eight-class line -- Gaia, Tartaros, Cybele, Idea, Hermes,
  Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus -- and every piece resolves to `knight_body01.dds`,
  `champ_body01_190.dds`, `magician_body01_m.dds` and friends. Importing it
  would have added nothing at all.

What is left after that filter is small. This set survives it: four textures new
to us, all four slots, male **and** female models on every row, English names,
and already at level 240 so nothing needs re-levelling.

--- the numbers are extrapolated from our own curve, not invented

Median DEF per slot across our armour runs 200 -> 210 -> 220 in near-constant
steps: cap +38, arms +34, foot +42, body +71. Continuing that for the two steps
to 240 gives per-slot medians of cap 223, body 499, arms 199, foot 252, i.e.
a factor of ~1.52 / 1.40 / 1.52 / 1.50 over Crystal. Each piece is scaled by its
slot's factor, so the **shape** of the Crystal set is preserved and only the tier
moves.

Sanity-checked against what it has to survive, because a big DEF jump can
trivialise content: damage is `ATK - DEF + 250`, total armour DEF goes 803 ->
1173, and Karkia's monsters run a median ATK of 1612 at levels 230-239 and 2785
at 240+. So the set is a 17-35% damage reduction, not immunity -- there is no
level at which these four pieces out-scale the incoming hit.

**One inherited oddity is deliberately propagated.** Crystal's Soldier cap (219)
and gloves (196) are ~50% above their own slot medians where the level-210 tier
spreads only 12%; scaling keeps that lead rather than quietly re-balancing a set
players already own. If it should be flattened, that is a `SCALE` edit here, not
a new import.

--- why --art-only

667's schema is 57 columns to our 36-37, and its stat columns are ability ids
fed into an unbounded `m_iAddValue[nType] += nValue` on both sides. `--art-only`
reads **no source cell at all**: it takes the model, plus the icon, and clones
every column from one of our own rows. The template is the matching Crystal
piece per class and slot, which carries the things that make a class line feel
like one -- the per-class bonus ability (type 10 Soldier / 11 Hawker / 12 Muse /
13 Dealer) and the RES shape. Only level, DEF, RES and price are overridden.

Note the Crystal rows carry **no class gate** -- their only requirement is
`(31, 220)`, a level. The class in the name is advisory, and that is inherited
here too: any class can wear any of these.

--- row space

Armour is sex-split, so each import appends one object to `LIST_M*.ZSC` and one
to `LIST_W*.ZSC` in lockstep. That is also why `--target-row` cannot be used:
the ZSC can only be appended to, so an item written into a blank STB row lower
down would find its art at the wrong index.

`LIST_CAP` is the binding table -- its highest named row is 988, leaving **11
ids** below the 999 ceiling that drop cells, QSD rewards and recipe inputs all
share. This set takes 4 of them and the Steam set will take 4 more, which fits;
a *third* set will not, and would need `zsc_build_append` taught to write at an
index before the table's blank rows lower down become usable.

Idempotent: a re-run appends duplicates, so it refuses to run if the names are
already present. `--dry-run` / `--verify`.

After running: restart the servers and re-bake the VFS. Spawn with
`/item 2:<id>` (cap), `3:` body, `4:` arms, `5:` foot -- GM access 2048.
